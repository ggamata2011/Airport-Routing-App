# Airport-Routing-App
An airport routing application written in C++ for a school project that uses Breadth First Search to find the shortest path through connecting airport flights

This application is mainly used as a demonstration of finding shortest paths through BFS, cities are case sensitive. Once a city has been input a list of cities that have matching names will be displayed in which you may choose by inputting the appropriate number. BFS algorithm will then be used and will display the least connecting flights one may need to take to arrive at their destination.

Note: When running be sure connection.txt is within the same folder as the executable, Enjoy!
